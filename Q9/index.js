// What will the code below output to the console and why?

var arr1 = "john".split(''); 

var arr2 = arr1.reverse();

var arr3 = "jones".split('');

arr2.push(arr3);

console.log("array 1: length=" + arr1.length + " last=" + arr1.slice(-1));

console.log("array 2: length=" + arr2.length + " last=" + arr2.slice(-1))

// output
// array 1: length=4 last=n
// array 2: length=7 last=s

// The reason for this is that the code first creates two arrays, arr1 and arr2. The arr1 array is created by splitting the string "john" into an array of characters. The arr2 array is created by reversing the arr1 array.

// Next, the code creates a third array, arr3, by splitting the string "jones" into an array of characters. The arr2 array is then pushed with the arr3 array.

// Finally, the code logs the length and last character of each array to the console.

// Here is a breakdown of the code:

var arr1 = "john".split(''); // Create an array of characters from the string "john"

var arr2 = arr1.reverse(); // Reverse the arr1 array

var arr3 = "jones".split(''); // Create an array of characters from the string "jones"

arr2.push(arr3); // Push the arr3 array onto the arr2 array

console.log("array 1: length=" + arr1.length + " last=" + arr1.slice(-1)); // Log the length and last character of the arr1 array

console.log("array 2: length=" + arr2.length + " last=" + arr2.slice(-1)); // Log the length and last character of the arr2 array

// The arr1 array has a length of 4 and the last character is n.
// The arr2 array has a length of 7 and the last character is s.
